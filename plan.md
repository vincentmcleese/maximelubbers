# Proposed Plan for Pixel-Perfect Copy of maximelubbers.com

## 1. Asset Collection

- Download all images, logos, and icons (or request originals if possible)
- Identify and match fonts (likely Google Fonts or similar)
- Extract color palette and spacing from screenshots or browser inspection

## 2. Project Setup

**Tech Stack Recommendation:**

- For a modern, maintainable site: Next.js (React) or plain React
- For a static site: HTML, CSS (with SCSS or Tailwind for easier styling), and vanilla JS

**Project Structure:**

- `/components` for reusable UI (Navbar, Footer, ContactForm, etc.)
- `/pages` for each main section (About, FOMO 2.0, etc.)
- `/public/assets` for images and downloads

## 3. Layout & Components

- Header/Navbar: Responsive, sticky, accessible
- Hero Section: Prominent name, tagline, and call-to-action
- About/Mission: Text blocks with headings and supporting images
- Testimonials: Styled quote section
- Specializations: Cards or sections for Speaker, Moderator, Workshops
- FOMO 2.0: Section with download button
- Collaborations: Logo grid
- Contact Form: Functional form with validation and submission feedback
- Footer: Copyright, logo, social links

## 4. Styling

- Use CSS variables or a theme for colors and fonts
- Match spacing, font sizes, and layout to the original site
- Ensure all breakpoints are covered for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 5. Functionality

- Contact form:
  - Can be set up to send emails via a service (e.g., EmailJS, Formspree, or backend API)
- Download button for FOMO 2.0 framework
- Navigation: Smooth scrolling or page transitions

## 6. Testing & Pixel-Perfect Adjustments

- Use browser dev tools and overlay screenshots to ensure pixel-perfect accuracy
- Test on all major browsers and devices

## 7. Deployment

- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred host
- Set up domain and SSL
